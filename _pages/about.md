Thanks for coming to my page! 

I am a 5th year PhD candidate at Stanford Sociology. I employ both quantitative and qualitative methods to answer questions about racial geography and political power among underrepresented groups in the U.S. The Changing Cities Research Lab (CCRL) is my intellectual home at Stanford. 

In my dissertation, I investigate the consequences of stratification on the housing market for vulnerable groups using restricted-access data from the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, and interviews with low-income Oakland renters. This research is housed at CCRL and funded in part by Stanford Impact Labs and in partnership with the City of Oakland's Department of Housing and Community Development.

My masters paper is a project on municipal annexations using analyses of Census place- and block-level shapefiles and Census/ACS demographic data across 2 decades.

In another project, with collaborators at UC-Irvine led by Naomi Sugie and funded through the National Science Foundation and the Yellow Chair Foundation, we use novel text messaging experiments to examine barriers towards voting among system-impacted people across the United States, in partnership with the Alliance for Safety and Justice. 

My work has additionally been supported in part through fellowships from Stanford Impact Labs and the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis. I was an Equity and Inclusion student fellow at the 2021 Fall APPAM Austin conference and I received the VPGE Research and Teaching Award through Stanford's Asian American Activities Center in 2022. I am always happy to share R code and publicly available data if they are not already available on my Github.

Prior to Stanford, I was a research associate at the Brennan Center for Justice. I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a B.A. in Sociology in 2016.
